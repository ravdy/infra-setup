This will currently just have sub-directories for each module, for ease of
working on them all together. However, the standard seems to be one entire
repository per module, so the next step will be one of:

1. Splitting them out into their own repositories.
2. Implementing JFrog's Terraform Module repository for easier access.
3. Deciding that sub-directories is okay.
